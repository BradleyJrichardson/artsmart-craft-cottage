# Project Plan
- Client __*Libby Richrdson*__
- Project Name __*Artsmart Craft Cottage*__
- Delivery Date __*Friday 26<sup>th</sup> July 2019*__

### Scope
The Artsmart Marketplace is an online sales point where clients and wholesalers can view products, add items to cart and checkout without the need for a profile.

Financial settlement will be processed by Stripe, meaning customer information will not be stored or sent through the marketplace.  

Database will contain product information and an Admin User (client) to access sales information.

### Roles
The project will be Pair Programmed for the entire basis of the MVP, once MVP is satisfied additional requirement will be discussed and build by the suggested party once approved.

Therefore, everyone will take part in building every part of the MPV, so roles will not be allocated.

### Timeline
Week 1 - Planning/documentation/sign-off to be completed.

Week 2 - MVP build, hosted and working.

Week 3 - Debugging, extra features and presentation planning.

### Objectives

### Risks
Project might not get completed due to time-frame.

Personalisation of Stripe payment system a forseen Risk, Stripe may need a second site to generate payments and track invoices, not in project scope.  
If needed, extra time will be allocated in week 3 to complete over extra features.

Customer information, ensuring customer information is handled securely through the site
